## Description:
*Project Name* is our collaborative storytelling website. After landing on our main page, the user can register or login to collaborate on others' stories or create their own. Once logged in, the user can access their Dashboard - the top header will have buttons where the user can return to the main page, see stories that others made, create a story, or logout (Home, See Stories, Create Story, and Logout, respectively). The body of the Dashboard will contain stories that the user created or previously edited (and can therefore read). Clicking on the title of the story in the Dashboard will bring the user to the story's contents.
