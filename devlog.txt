In __init__.py
- configured the basic stuff so the mainpage opens
- created routes for login, create_account that
take you to forms to do those things
- created routes for handling submission of login
or create_account and wrote pseudocode for the steps
necessary to have those working
In templates
- created templates folder
- made main_page.html which just renders the root 
route and has links that take you to login/create 
- made login_create.html which conditionally
renders the different forms to log in or make
account because this way there are fewer files
Next steps :)
1. Create the 2 databases in design doc
2. Configure the submit functions that now have
pseudocode
3. Configure sessions
