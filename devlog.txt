In design.pdf:
- Made the program components section more specific
- Cleared up how we would implement a stories list in the users table
- Delegated tasks amongst our group
- Added flask and html file specification section

In __init__.py
- configured the basic stuff so the mainpage opens
- created routes for login, create_account that
take you to forms to do those things
- created routes for handling submission of login
or create_account and wrote pseudocode for the steps
necessary to have those working
In templates
- created templates folder
- made main_page.html which just renders the root
route and has links that take you to login/create
- made login_create.html which conditionally
renders the different forms to log in or make
account because this way there are fewer files
Next steps :)
1. Create the 2 databases in design doc
2. Configure the submit functions that now have
pseudocode
3. Configure sessions

In __init__.py
- Created db file that contains user and stories table
- Added to user table with username and password entered in login_create form
- Checks whether or not username is already taken, and outputs error if it is
- Checks whether or not the passwords match in user creation, and outputs error if they do not
- Changed input type to password for password parameters
- Commented out submit_login so the python file can run currently
Next steps
1. Configure submit_login function
2. Configure sessions
3. Begin story creation
